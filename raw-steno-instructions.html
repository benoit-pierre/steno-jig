<div id="form" class="wrapper">

	<p>For finger drills and learning the keys on the steno keyboard,
	you'll want to make Plover send the raw output instead of
	translating it into words. To do this, show Plover's main window
	(<code>PHROBGS</code> is the usual chord for this, or there should
	be an icon in the task bar). Then un-check the checkboxes next to
	<code>main.json</code> and <code>user.json</code> to turn them off
	temporarily.</p>

	<div style="text-align:center"><img src="plover-4.png" alt="Plover main window, showing the
	dictionary list with checkboxes to disable each one."></div>

	<hr style="margin: 2em 0px 3em">

	<p>Alternatively, you can open the Plugins Manager from the Plover
	main window and install the <code>plover_dict_commands</code>
	plugin. Restart Plover.
	</p>

	<p>Define a dictionary entry to switch to raw steno: maybe in
	<code>commands.json</code>. I think many people use
	<code>RA*U</code> as <code>{PLOVER:solo_dict:+commands.json}</code>.
	This will ensure that <code>commands.json</code> is enabled, and
	will disable all other dictionaries. Then you'll need a definition
	to enable your dictionaries again. The command for this is
	<code>{PLOVER:end_solo_dict}</code>.</p>

	<p>Personally I do this slightly differently: I have a special
	dictionary <code>return-from-raw.json</code> (which I put at the
	very bottom of the dictionary list) with the following contents:</p>

	<div><code><pre>{
	"RA*U": "{PLOVER:end_solo_dict}",
	"R-R": "{^~|\n^}",
	"STK-G": "{#right}"
}</pre></code></div>

	<p>Then my normal <code>RA*U</code> command is
	<code>{PLOVER:solo_dict:+return-from-raw.json}</code>. So I can use
	<code>RA*U</code> to toggle raw-mode on and off, and in raw mode I
	only have Return (which you press three times to repeat an exercise
	in Steno Jig) and the right arrow (which randomly generates a new
	exercise).</p>
